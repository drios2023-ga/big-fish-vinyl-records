# Big Fish Vinyl Records and Uniques - Record Store Website

This is a website for a record store that will be reopening in 2024. It allows the owner to post “Records of the Week” that can be promoted on Instagram and Facebook. It features a model-view-controller (MVC) architecture and  demonstrates full CRUD capability as well as responsive design. Technologies used include HTML, CSS, Express, MongoDB, and Cloudinary (for the photo upload).

## Website Design
This website was designed with a "mobile-first" approach and is viewable on any device (computer, table, mobile phone). It features full CRUD capability and a model-view-controller architecture. 

A monochrome layout was selected to give a clean look that would make the album covers featured on the "Records of the Week" page to stand out. The Google Font selected was Caveat, which not only matches the company's pre-existing logo but also provides a playful, fun look for the website while still being very readable.

Future changes included adding secure authentication to protect the Admin page.
